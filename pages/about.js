        My name is John Doe and I am a graphic designer with 5 years of
        experience. I specialize in creating visually stunning designs that
        capture the essence of a brand. I have a strong background in graphic
        design, with a focus on branding and marketing. I am passionate about
        creating designs that are both beautiful and effective.

      <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4">
        I have experience working with clients in a wide range of industries,
        including fashion, technology, and finance. I am highly skilled in Adobe
        Creative Suite and always strive to stay up-to-date with the latest
        design trends and techniques.

        When I'm not working on design projects, you can find me exploring new
        art and design techniques, experimenting with new software and tools,
        and staying active through hiking, and rock climbing.
